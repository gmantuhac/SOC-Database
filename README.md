# University of California San Diego Schedule of Classes Database

This project is a pseudo-recreation of the UC San Diego Schedule of Classes database. I decided to use this database after countless hours of just browsing Webreg, the registration system, and the Schedule of Classes itself. 

The purpose of doing this project was to gain a proficient understanding in:
- Database construction in SQL
- Manipulation of data in the database
- ER diagram creation
- General continuous understanding of data science.

I created a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qbimJhgVmdafJ3FTl2C2cmlm8cHbdVP1ni1Pt6GFaag/edit?usp=sharing) shwocasing my journey throughout the project. This Google Doc showcases my thoughts, struggles, aspirations, and feelings towards the project. Every entry was typed at the end of each day when working on the project and gives a raw perspective within the notes I added. Each day does **not** represent a full day's work and typically represented only an average of 2 hours of work in a day. In the future, I hope to increase my productivity and focus in order to work more efficiently for future projects.

I created a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T_CuXrdE896wNF9M6evbJyK3wtGDMDU_mGR-YTnFgxY/edit?usp=sharing) detailing the specific tables I had to create before coding the tables on SQL. There is also a separate sheet showcasing an example database where I sampled different couses in select quarters and listed them on the Google Sheet. You may see the code to add the example database in SOCdatabaseex.txt

I created an ER diagram representing the full database I created. The ER diagram was created using Lucidchart. (Which was an extremely smooth experience to use and I highly reccomend if anyone wants to create simple diagrams on)

While this project is a relatively simple project, I am extremely proud of the work I've done. This is the first full on project that I have dedicated towards that is not within my academic courses; which feels refreshing to do. The project has shown me a career path I can persue and I will take steps towards continuous learning in this path. 

As a statement for myself: *I am a strong individual and will overcome hurdles to build a good future for myself.*
